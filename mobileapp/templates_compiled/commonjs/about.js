At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live\nspeakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a\nsmall group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx,\nwhere x=independently organized TED event.</p>\n<p>The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx\nprogram, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.*\n(*Subject to certain rules and regulations)</p>\n\n<b>About TED</b>\n<p>TED is an annual event where some of the world’s leading\nthinkers and doers are invited to share what they are most\npassionate about. “TED” stands for Technology, Entertainment,\nDesign — three broad subject areas that are, collectively,\nshaping our future. And in fact, the event is broader still,\nshowcasing ideas that matter in any discipline. Attendees have\ncalled it “the ultimate brain spa” and “a four-day journey into\nthe future.” The diverse audience — CEOs, scientists, creatives,\nphilanthropists — is almost  as extraordinary as the speakers,\nwho have included Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, Jane Goodall,\nFrank Gehry, Paul Simon, Sir Richard Branson, Philippe Starck\nand Bono.</p>\n<p>TED was ﬁrst held in Monterey, California, in 1984. In 2001,\nChris Anderson’s Sapling Foundation acquired TED from its\nfounder, Richard Saul Wurman. In recent years, TED has expanded\nto include an international conference, TEDGlobal;\nmedia initiatives, including TED Talks and TED.com;\nand the TED Prize. TED2010, “What the world Needs Now,”\nwill be held Springs, California.</p>\n-->\n\n</div>');}return __p.join('');
